# compiler_proj3

A little compiler which can generate java bytecode from a unexisting programming language, which is called Rust-.

A simple version of true Rust, which is a open-source language of Mozilla.

Now, it can only recognize integer-type variable. In this project, no floating-point number, no string variable, etc.

To sum up, it is just a very simple compiler, and it has not finished yet.
